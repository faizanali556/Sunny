          <h1>Our Team</h1>
          <p>
            Buffer started as a Startup Sprint project in November 2010 to solve
            a problem our Founder and CEO Joel Gascoigne was experiencing â€” he
            wanted to space out when his tweets were sent. The idea gained
            hundreds of users within the first few months and eventually grew to
            add social networks, to go beyond purely publishing to social media
            into analytics, engagement, and even to building micro sites. Today,
            Buffer is one of the most well-known social media marketing tools
            serving small businesses, creators, and individuals. <br />
            The Buffer team was initially just a few people working on a project
            they believed in, and steadily started growing after the founders
            joined an accelerator in August 2011. Over the next few years,
            Buffer teammates joined from wherever they were based as Bufferâ€™s
            founders traveled and built Buffer. In 2013, we decided to commit to
            being a fully remote and distributed team, giving up our office
            space. That decision marked just one example of the Buffer team
            choosing our own path with how we operate as we build Buffer. We
            also share the whole teamâ€™s salaries, part of our value of
            transparency, and our whole company works a four-day work week.
            <br /><br />
            All that to say, Buffer is a product built to help our customers get
            off the ground and grow via organic marketing, and the Buffer team
            is an optimistic and gratitude-filled group of remote workers
            scattered around the world and dedicated to creating a product our
            customers will use and love.
